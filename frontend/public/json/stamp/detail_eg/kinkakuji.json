  "text": "A symbol of Kitayama culture built by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the 3rd shogun of the Muromachi shogunate. The Shariden's second and third stories are covered in gold leaf, and the 'upside-down Kinkaku' reflected in Kyokochi Pond changes its expression with the seasons. The garden is designated both a Special Historic Site and a Special Place of Scenic Beauty. With highlights like the 'Rikushu-no-Matsu' pine, you can experience the power of opulent beauty."
