  "text": "Jishoji (commonly known as Ginkaku-ji) symbolizes Higashiyama culture. Its charm lies in a simple, refined aesthetic; the white-sand 'Ginsadan' and the conical 'Kougetsudai' are especially striking. The garden harmonizes dry landscaping with moss, inviting you to experience the quiet spirit of wabi-sabi."
